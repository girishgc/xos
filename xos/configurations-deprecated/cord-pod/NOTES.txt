Notes on setup

Requirements:
* admin-openrc.sh: Admin credentials for your OpenStack cloud
* id_rsa[.pub]: Keypair for use by the various services
* node_key: Private key that allows root login to the compute nodes

Steps for bringing up the POD:

OpenStack
* Configure management net
  - mgmtbr on head nodes
  - dnsmasq on head1 using cord config file
* Install OpenStack using the openstack-cluster-install repo

VTN
* onos-cord VM is created by openstack-cluster-install
* Bring up ONOS
  # cd cord; docker-compose up -d
* On each compute node it's necessary perform a few manual steps (FIX ME)
  - Disable neutron-plugin-openvswitch-agent. As root:
    # service neutron-plugin-openvswitch-agent stop
    # echo manual > /etc/init/neutron-plugin-openvswitch-agent.override
  - Clean up OVS: delete br-int and any other bridges
  - Listen for connections from VTN:
    # ovs-appctl -t ovsdb-server ovsdb-server/add-remote ptcp:6641

XOS
* xos VM is created by openstack-cluster-install
  - requirements listed above should already be satisfied by install
* cd xos/xos/configurations/cord-pod
* Bring up XOS cord-pod configuration
  # make
  # make vtn
  # make cord
* Login to XOS at http://xos
